# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

ðŸŽ“ Machine Learning course project

This project is a **Rainfall Prediction Classifier** built using historical weather data.  
It compares **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models to predict if it will rain tomorrow.

## Models and Performance

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Accuracy: ~70%
  - True Positive Rate (TPR): ~50%
- **Random Forest**
  - Accuracy: ~72%
  - True Positive Rate (TPR): ~60%
- **Key Feature:** Humidity at 3pm
- **Conclusion:** Random Forest is the better predictor for rain tomorrow.

## Project Highlights

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
